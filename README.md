# First-Portfolio

My First in-class Portfolio. 

I have used the Bootstrap components as a guide but I have made changed where I felt necessary. I also coded all the containers and footers myself. The navbar is fully responsive as well as all the links on the application. 


I have included my own personal information such as a brief bio and an image as well as 3 interesting things about me in the 'Portfolio' section.
